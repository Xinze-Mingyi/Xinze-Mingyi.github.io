I am Xinze, a forth year undergraduate student from the University of International Business and Economics, majoring in Economics. 

My research focuses on game theory, statistics, operations research and machine learning.

I am working on improving my mathematical skills mainly by self-study. I have learned the real analysis and complex analysis by myself, and now I am diving into the convex optimization. 

I will study for the mphil in economics research program at the University of Cambridge in the fall of 2024.

After that, I plan to earn a methmatical degree in Cambridge further for the purpose of interest and my current research.
